I almost bought this today, but have instead opted for a Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G for the following reasons: - price equivalence (Samsung has slashed the cost from ?699) - larger screen, faster refresh rate - water and dust proofing (non existent on Pixel) - expandable memory - wireless charging I almost didn't buy the Samsung because: - comes with Samsung's bloated UI and stuff you can't turn off - UI lacks cleaner, smarter features of clean Android - no headphone jack The price of this Pixel needs to fall substantially to reflect its far lower specification, compared to the far cheaper Samsung.####[('price', 'price', 'negative', 'needs to fall'), ('NULL', 'batterylongevity charging method', 'positive', 'wireless charging')]
